# 8-bit Super Register (VHDL)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements an **8-bit Super Register** using **VHDL**.
It was developed as part of the **Digital Systems Design Lab** course.

The register supports multiple operations such as storage, shifting,
rotation, and counting, all controlled by a 3-bit control signal.

## ⚙️ Features
- 8-bit synchronous register
- Rising-edge clock operation
- Parallel load
- Shift left / shift right
- Rotate left / rotate right
- Up counter / Down counter
- Flag output for boundary detection

## 🎛 Control Operations

| Control Code | Operation |
|-------------|----------|
| 000 | Hold |
| 001 | Parallel Load |
| 010 | Shift Right |
| 011 | Shift Left |
| 100 | Rotate Right |
| 101 | Rotate Left |
| 110 | Count Up |
| 111 | Count Down |

## 🚩 Flag Logic
The `flag` output is asserted when:
- Register value = `00000000`
- Register value = `11111111`

This is useful for detecting overflow and underflow conditions.
